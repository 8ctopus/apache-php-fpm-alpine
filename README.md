# docker apache php-fpm alpine

A super light docker web server with Apache and php-fpm on top of Alpine Linux for development purposes

- Apache 2.4.52 with SSL
- php-fpm 8.0.14 or 7.4.21
- Xdebug 3.1.2 - debugger and profiler
- [SPX prolifer 0.4.11](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/php-spx)
- composer 2.1.12
- zsh 5.8
- Alpine 3.15.0

The docker image size is 61 MB.

_Note_: for the web server plus MariaDB, check https://github.com/8ctopus/php-sandbox

## cool features

- php 8 or 7
- Apache and php configuration files are exposed on the host.
- Just works with any domain name.
- https is configured out of the box.
- All changes to config files are automatically applied (hot reload).
- Xdebug is configured for remote debugging (no headaches).

_Note_: On Windows [hot reload doesn't work with WSL 2](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4739), you need to use the legacy Hyper-V.

## use container

Starting the container with `docker-compose` offers all functionalities.

```sh
# start container in detached mode on linux and mac in shell
docker-compose up &

# start container in detached mode on Windows in cmd
start /B docker-compose up

# view logs
docker-compose logs -f

# stop container
docker-compose stop

# delete container
docker-compose down
```

Alternatively the container can also be started with `docker run`.

```sh
# php 8
docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name web 8ct8pus/apache-php-fpm-alpine:latest

# php 7.4
docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name web 8ct8pus/apache-php-fpm-alpine:1.1.3

CTRL-Z to detach

docker stop container
```

## access website

    http://localhost/
    https://localhost/

The source code is located inside the `html` directory.

## set website domain name

To set the domain name to www.test.com, edit the environment variable in the docker-compose file

    environment:
      - DOMAIN=www.test.com

Add this line to the system host file. Editing the file requires administrator privileges.

    C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

    127.0.0.1 test.net www.test.net

## add https

To remove "Your connection is not private" nag screens, import the certificate authority file under ssl/certificate_authority.pem in the browser's certificates under Trusted Root Certification Authorities.

## Xdebug debugger

This repository is configured to debug php code in Visual Studio Code. To start debugging, open the VSCode workspace then select `Run > Start debugging` then open the site in the browser.
The default config is to stop on entry which stops at the first line in the file. To only stop on breakpoints, set `stopOnEntry` to `false` in `.vscode/launch.json`.

For other IDEs, set the Xdebug debugging port to `9001`.

To troubleshoot debugger issues, check the `log/xdebug.log` file.

If `host.docker.internal` does not resolve within the container, update the xdebug client host within `docker/etc/php/conf.d/xdebug.ini` to the docker host ip address.

```ini
xdebug.client_host          = 192.168.65.2
```

## Xdebug profiler

To start profiling, add the `XDEBUG_PROFILE` variable to the request as a GET, POST or COOKIE.

    http://localhost/?XDEBUG_PROFILE

Profiles are stored in the `log` directory and can be analyzed with tools such as [webgrind](https://github.com/jokkedk/webgrind).

## SPX profiler

To start profiling with SPX:

- Access the [SPX control panel](http://localhost/?SPX_KEY=dev&SPX_UI_URI=/)
- Check checkbox `Whether to enable SPX profiler for your current browser session. No performance impact for other clients.`
- Run script to profile
- Refresh the SPX control panel tab and the report will be available at the bottom of the screen. Click it to show the report in a new tab.

_Note_: Disable Xdebug debugger `xdebug.remote_enable` for accurate measurements.

## access container through command line

```sh
docker exec -it web zsh
```

## use development image

- build docker development image

```sh
docker build -t apache-php-fpm-alpine:dev .
```

- `rm -rf docker/`
- in docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  web:
    # development image
    image: apache-php-fpm-alpine:dev
```

- `docker-compose up`
- open browser at `localhost`

## extend docker image

In this example, we add the php-curl extension.

```sh
docker-compose up --detach
docker exec -it web zsh
apk add php-curl
exit

docker-compose stop
docker commit web apache-php-fpm-alpine-curl:dev
```

To use the new image, update the image link in the docker-compose file.

## update docker image

When you update the docker image version, it's important to know that the existing configuration in `docker/etc` may cause problems.
To solve the problems, backup your config then delete all config files:

```sh
rm -rf docker/
```

## build php spx

```sh
cd php-spx
./build.sh
cp lib/alpine-3.15.0/spx.so ../include/php-spx/
```

## release docker image

Only for repository owner

```sh
docker build -t 8ct8pus/apache-php-fpm-alpine:1.2.3 .
docker push 8ct8pus/apache-php-fpm-alpine:1.2.3
```
